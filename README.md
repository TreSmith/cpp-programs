1. Kilowaffles.cpp
- Have you ever wanted to use a different measurement? Try our kilowaffles converter. We take any old boring measurement and make it into kilowaffles! (1000 waffles) Essentially I had an idea with another friend, we decided to make our own form of measurement by using the average size of a waffle and making kilowaffles.
